										<p>Sky surveys image hundreds of millions of galaxies, but hardly any of them will ever be examined by an expert and assigned a label. This provides a number of hurdles for training standard supervised machine learning models to classify galaxy types and discover rare objects.</p>
										<p>Utilizing self-supervised learning, an emerging paradigm in computer vision capabable of <i>learning without labelled information</i>, I compiled a dataset and distiled information from nearly 100 million images from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys.</p>
										<p>Check out a few of my works below where I developed tools for exploration of this massive dataset, discovered 1600 extremely rare strong gravitational lenses, and constructed models to automatically classifiy millions of galaxies.</p>

									  <p>Searching for signs of rare events is hard enough when you know what you are looking for, but what about when you're looking for completely unknown signs of new physics?</p>

									    <p>The LHC Olympics (LHCO) data challenge was created to develop methods for this purpose. Participants were provided with a set of "black-box" datasets and charged with identifying any anomalous events - without having any idea what these events might look like.</p>
									  <p>While anomaly detection is a key application of machine learning, it is generally more focused on the detection of outlying samples in the low probability density regions of data. I instead developed a method for <t>unsupervised in-distribution anomaly detection</t> using a conditional density estimator, designed to find unique, yet completely unknown, sets of samples residing in high probability density regions</p>
									  <p>Outperforming 12 other teams, we managed to detect a new particle appearing in only 0.08% of 1 million collision events, and took home the gold medal</p>

											<h3 class="major">A probabilistic autoencoder for type Ia supernovae</h3>
											<p>Type Ia supernovae are rare yet extremeley useful objects for mapping the expansion history of our universe. Yet their complexity cannot be modelled from first principles, which requires us to understand them in a data-driven mannor. To do so I devoloped a Probabilistic Autoencoder to study the diversity of spectra we observe from them, to identify objects that do not fit average trends, and to minimize the error that propagates into cosmological analyses.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/websky.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">The WebSky Suite of Extragalactic CMB simulations</h3>
											<p>Realistic simulations of the universe are necessary to develop and test scientic analyses, but are a key technical challenge due to the large dynamic range and accuracy required. I worked to modernize, parallellize, and optimize performance of a the mass-Peak Patch simulational pipeline to run on high-performance computing clusters. After completing testing and development of the package, I constructed and released some of the most advanced simualtions to date - the Websky suite</p>

											<h3 class="major">Machine learning in cosmology</h3>
											<p>The rapid pace of machine learning applications in science is difficult to keep on-top of, yet recognizing trends and analysing state-of-the-art methods adds critical tools to your toolbelt. Over the past 4 years I've curated a public list of all machine learning papers in cosmology. Take a look to see whats been going on in the field!</p>

											<h3 class="major">A volumetric deep Convolutional Neural Network for simulation of mock dark matter halo catalogues</h3>
											<p>Simulations of the universe from the initial conditions to the present day are computationally expensive. To speed things up, we trained a U-net on 3D volumes of the universe to predict the final structure given the initial conditions. This allowed us to skip the whole simulation and jump right to the final answer.</p>

											<h3 class="major">COVID-19 in the USA: A state-by-state investigation</h3>
											<p>The early stages of the pandemic contained extreme uncertainty, so beginning March 2020 I compiled data from the CDC, NYT, and a variety of other outlets to visualize and study mortality trends. By comparing 2020 mortality from all causes to the official coronavirus death toll, I uncovered in a few states clear evidence for an excess of deaths above those officially attributed to the virus.</p>
